This project was completed for the Knowledge Representation course at Vrije Universiteit

## Introduction
Human discussion can be formally represented by logical programming. We show that using the preferred semantics of argumentation frameworks, we can implement a Discussion Game to determine acceptability of arguments. Furthermore, we answer questions to Credulous Decision Problems by implementing preferred, stable, complete and grounded semantics.
